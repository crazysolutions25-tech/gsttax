    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>
      GST Tax Consultancy is an informational and advisory platform focused on
      helping businesses, professionals and individuals understand and comply
      with India’s GST and Income Tax laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tax compliance involves multiple rules, frequent changes and strict
      timelines. Our objective is to simplify these complexities by presenting
      tax laws, procedures and compliance requirements in a clear and structured
      manner.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>
      We provide guidance and professional support across a wide range of
      taxation and compliance areas. Our services cover GST registration and
      return filing, income tax compliance, TDS returns, accounting support,
      audits and statutory compliance requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each service is explained in detail, covering applicability, rules,
      documents required, due dates and penalties, enabling informed decision
      making.
    </p>

    <h3>Who This Platform Is For</h3>
    <ul class="points">
      <li>Small and medium businesses</li>
      <li>Startups and entrepreneurs</li>
      <li>Professionals and freelancers</li>
      <li>Partnership firms, LLPs and companies</li>
      <li>Individuals seeking tax compliance clarity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Our approach is compliance-first and information-driven. Rather than
      focusing on promotions, we prioritise accuracy, clarity and practical
      relevance. All information is structured to help users understand their
      obligations and consequences of non-compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that correct knowledge is the foundation of proper compliance
      and risk management.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Tax Compliance Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Non-compliance with GST, Income Tax or TDS laws can lead to penalties,
      interest, notices and legal complications. Timely registration, accurate
      return filing and proper record maintenance are essential for smooth
      business operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this platform, we aim to assist users in understanding and meeting
      these obligations efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Need Professional Assistance?</h3>
    <p>
      While this platform provides comprehensive information, professional
      guidance may be required for specific cases or complex compliance matters.
      You may reach out to us for personalised assistance and advisory support.
